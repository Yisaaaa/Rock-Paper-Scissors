# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

## From The Odin Project

This is a simple rock and paper scissors game from [The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

Rock paper scissors is my very first project using HTML, CSS, and JS.

### What I got from doing this?
* It deepened my knowledge of basic **JavaScript**.
* Learned how to use **event listeners**.
* Practiced my skills on CSS **transitions** and **animations**.
* Learned to manipulate the **DOM** (Document Object Model).
* Learned to **organize** my code into several helper functions.

### Summary
* This project was really **fun**!
* Added some **damage effect** and **sound** to make it more cool.
* I also made it to be **responsive**!
